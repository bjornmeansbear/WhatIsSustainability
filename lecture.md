# What is Sustainability?

We need to all have a shared reference for what sustainability is.

The normal introduction to contemporary sustainability is through the triple bottom line

{triple bottom line slide}

This frames economics, society, and nature as separate spheres all capable of their own types of sustainability which in the best case scenario would overlap to create true or full sustainability.

This is where part of the problem with the word sustainbility lies.

People talking about sustainability in only one of these arenas might be thinking they are talking about sustainability

## Why is this the case?

Sustainability is sort of a weird word. It doesn't mean anything on its own. It only means "capable of being sustained" or "maintaining a system over time" -- you have to declare what is capable of being sustained; what system is meant to last over time.

> That which is maintained over time

> Capable of being sustained

> Any action that does not degrade the systems supporting it (General generic Definition of Sust.) [what is your system's boundary??? is it the whole universe? otherwise you won't really be sustainable]

The most common usage of sustainability today usually refers to practices that are more environmentally friendly than others. It is commonly used as a synonym for green. People that talk about sustainability are often considered to be environmentalists perhaps?

## Sidetrack to environmentalism:

In america and europe since the end of the 19th century even what we think of as environmentalism has drastically shifted. We started out with this idea, during the height of the industrial revolution, that there was "pristine" nature; untouched by humanity; that we could segregate and preserve as purely natural spaces. Nature and Human were different worlds we had to keep apart. In america this starts the trend towards large national and state controlled parks. John Muir, Teddy Roosevelt... these people wanted to preserve a nature as separate from humans.

As we industrialized further, we got to this point, sort of in the 60s, again in the US/Europe, where environmentalism really became called as such... But, it had a new aim. No longer was the goal just preservation of what was natural, but we started to understand that we were really harshly impacting our environs. Human's imprint was everywhere. We had to start undoing our impacts. This is the rise of green peace and both peaceful and aggressive environmental groups start appearing.

Then we get to where we are today; we seem to have a much more holistic worldview really starting to see that nature is everything. Man isn't apart from nature. Humans ARE nature. We can coexist with nature if we just change everything about what we do... whew. Environmentalism evolves into sustainabilitism or sustainism or something...

{I could make that section much better and more detailed if necessary}

## Back to sustainability.

The triple bottom line thinking -- these things being separate but overlapping -- leads one to definitions of sustainability that try to value all these things equally... so:

> Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. (Brundtland Commission, 1987 -- by far the most reference "definition")

{need to cite these quotes to weblinks where possible}

> Leave the world better than you found it, take no more than you need, try not to harm life or the environment, make amends if you do (Paul Hawken)

> Do unto others as you would have them do to you (the ethic of reciprocity; originally attributed to confuscious; aka the golden rule)

> Equity over time. Think of it as extending the golden rule through time... Do unto future generations as you would have them do unto you. (Robert Gilman, context institute)

> Living and working together for a common good. (Japanese principle of "Kyosei").

> Don't eat your seed corn (farmer colloquialism).

> Waste = Food (Cradle to Cradle/McDonough & Braungart).

> Improving the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of life's supporting systems (? attribute missing in my notes ?)\

> Living within limits.

> Affluence without guilt; not sacrifice and restriction. (Alex Steffen, founder of WorldChanging).

These all are great one liners. But they don't necessarily help one understand how things might be sustained; how things are linked; they don't all even focus on all aspects of the sustainable trinity.

What else? what's missing?

{SpaceShip earth}

## A Closed System

Spaceship Earth (Fullerism) -- remember, we live on a spaceship with finite resources -- pretty much the only inputs to our planetary system from outside are our sun's energy (and the occasionally meteorite). And we lose heat and helium out to space. Everything else is limited in supply; and is stuck here with us ... But we're on this spaceship together hurtling through space...

What to understand: Vast 3D webs of energy flows and living beings (living systems?) … Understanding the interconnections among economy, society, and environment (Everything is connected).

## Everything is connected!

> It's all the Blanket (I Heart Huckabees).

This gives us this different way that "sustainability" in different arena's might be diagramed. The economy, which seems so important and gigantic is really just a small creation of our society -- with no society, there is no such thing as economy. And, society is really just a construct of nature: no nature, no society and thus no economy. So, all decisions are really decisiosnt aht need to be made in accordance with worrying about preserving nature/elongating the natural worlds energy outputs so we can keep this place as habitable as possible... These ideas get us closer to a "sustainable" mindset:

John Ehrenfeld states in the book Flourishing that "the key to do something about sustainability is that you first have to say what it is you want to sustain." To define sustainable art practice we must first define what it is we are sustaining. Ehrenfeld wants to sustain that "all humans and other life should flourish." (Pg 23 in flourishing). Using Ehrenfeld's thinking, A Sustainable art practice is then work made for those that believe all life should flourish; or works made as symbols for sustainability-as-flourishing; and works made with materials and processes and ideals that promote and sustain the state of all life flourishing too.

> All life should have the opportunity to Flourish (John Ehrenfeld).

> the Welfare of All Life (Massive Change/Bruce Mau).

> For the artist communication with nature remains the most essential condition. The artist is human; himself nature; part of nature within natural space. / Paul Klee, 1923

These definitions deal with ethics and foresight... and understanding that everything is connected.

These ideas also get to be more Restorative; Preventative; Adaptive; Resilient...

But then… ugh! what do those words mean!

However, they still don't make it clear what you are sustaining -- just a better vision for what we need to strive towards; how to intellectually wrap our minds better around the issues. See that we're alone and with finite resources.

Start seeing that everything is connected. An economic choice isn’t only an economic choice. An urban planning choice isn’t only a societal choice.

I guess my point here is to focus on this idea that “what is sustainable” is not a simple binary “this is” and “this isn’t” situation. Because of what the word’s direct definition is, and how its become used in popular culture, it is imperative that you are clear in what YOU want to make last over time. 

It is also important to be clear about what you are using as an outer system border. Is it your life? your city? your country? our whole planet? the universe?

Questions???

No one wakes up with the goal of destroying the planet each morning. Yet, each day our collective choices do just that.

woah.

And that’s a great lead in to another prompt.

What do you want to sustain?

//////////////////////////////////////

Bruce Mau phrases this similarly in his writings around the Massive Change project: Our project is the welfare of all life as a practical objective.

A Sustainable work’s form must declare that "humans and all life should flourish." How might an aesthetic or form convey this message? What aesthetic or form conveys this message? Are there visual choices that are more sustainable?

> To call a work of design beautiful is to recognize it as a rendition of values critical to our flourishing. A transubstantiation of our individual ideals in material medium.  \
— Alain de Botton, Architecture of Happiness

AdB provides some insights for how we might integrate sustainability & object creating: if beauty in a piece embodies one's values then non-sustainable art would be non-beautiful art -- any art work not looking out for the welfare of all life is bad, ugly work! Only works that inspires sustainable ideals count as beautiful.

Sustainable art work: Beautiful things; Sentimental things; Utilitarian things... (there are those categories of things; and then there is everything else. Everything else need not exist). Sustainable cultural production needs to be the "prettiest" stuff; the most meaningful stuff; and the most functional stuff — preferably all of the above. BUT! beauty; meaning; these are subject to context (beauty is in the eye of the beholder after all?) — does the context of "the welfare of all life" help people see things the same way? -- does this mean that there is no singular "sustainable" design solution?

Nature does not typically solve design problems with singular solutions. There are usually many overlapping and resilient ways things work out in or world's ecosystems. So: sustainability may then have many definitions; sustainable design might provide many styles, aesthetics, processes, and methods...

Design has helped to change and shape the world (for better or for worse) in gigantic, important ways. Whatever happens next, the world will not be like it is today -- either because we do something to make it better for the welfare of all life; or because we just keep on keeping on as is and destroy all life.
