# What is Sustainability?

We need to all have a shared reference for what sustainability is.

The normal introduction to contemporary sustainability is through the triple bottom licensed

{triple bottom line slide}

This frames economics, society, and nature as seperate spheres all capable of their own types of sustainability which in the best case scenario would overlap to create true or full sustainability.

This is where part of the problem with the word sustainbility lies.

People talking about sustainability in only one of these arenas might be thinking they are talking about sustainability

## Why is this the case?

well, sustainability is sort of a weird word. It doesn't mean anyhting on its own. It only means "capable of being sustained" or "maintaining a system over time" -- you have to declare what is capable of being sustained; what system is meant to last over time.

> That which is maintained over time

> Capable of being sustained

> Any action that does not degrade the systems supporting it (General generic Definition of Sust.) [what is your system's boundary??? is it the whole universe? otherwise you won't really be sustainable]

The most common usage of sustainability today usually refers to practices that are more environmentally friendly than others. It is commonly used as a synonym for green. People that talk about sustainability are often considered to be environmentalists perhaps?

## Sidetrack to environmentalism:

In america and europe since the end of the 19th century even what we think of as environmentalism has drastically shifted. We started out with this idea, during the height of the industrial revolution, that there was "pristine" nature; untouched by humanity; that we could segregate and preserve as purely natural spaces. Nature and Human were different worlds we had to keep apart. In america this starts the trend towards large national and state controlled parks. John Muir, Teddy Roosevelt... these people wanted to preserve a nature as separate from humans.

As we industrialized further, we got to this point, sort of in the 60s, again in the US/Europe, where environmentalism really became called as such... But, it had a new aim. No longer was the goal just preservation of what was natural, but we started to understand that we were really harshly impacting our environs. Human's imprint was everywhere. We had to start undoing our impacts. This is the rise of green peace and both peaceful and aggressive environmental groups start appearing.

Then we get to where we are today; we seem to have a much more holistic worldview really starting to see that nature is everything. Man isn't apart from nature. Humans ARE nature. We can coexist with nature if we just change everything about what we do... whew. Environmentalism evolves into sustainabilitism or sustainism or something...

{I could make that section much better and more detailed if necessary}

## Back to sustainability.

The triple bottom line thinking -- these things being separate but overlapping -- leads one to definitions of sustainability that try to value all these things equally... so:

> Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. (Brundtland Commission, 1987 -- by far the most reference "definition")

{need to cite these quotes to weblinks where possible}

> Leave the world better than you found it, take no more than you need, try not to harm life or the environment, make amends if you do (Paul Hawken)

> Do unto others as you would have them do to you (the ethic of reciprocity; originally attributed to confuscious; aka the golden rule)

> Equity over time. Think of it as extending the golden rule through time... Do unto future generations as you would have them do unto you. (Robert Gilman, context institute)

> Living and working together for a common good. (Japanese principle of "Kyosei").

> Don't eat your seed corn (farmer colloquialism).

> Waste = Food (Cradle to Cradle/McDonough & Braungart).

> Improving the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of life's supporting systems (? attribute missing in my notes ?)\

> Living within limits.

> Affluence without guilt; not sacrifice and restriction. (Alex Steffen, founder of WorldChanging).

These all are great one liners. But they don't necessarily help one understand how things might be sustained; how things are linked; they don't all even focus on all aspects of the sustainable trinity.

What else? what's missing?

{SpaceShip earth}

Spaceship Earth (Fullerism) -- remember, we live on a spaceship with finite resources -- pretty much the only inputs to our planetary system from outside are our sun's energy (and the occasionally meteorite). And we lose heat and helium out to space. Everything else is limited in supply; and is stuck here with us ... But we're on this spaceship together hurtling through space...

What to understand: Vast 3D webs of energy flows and living beings (living systems?) -- Everything is connected!

Understanding the interconnections among economy, society, and environment (Everything is connected).

This gives us this different way that "sustainability" in different arena's might be diagramed. The economy, which seems so important and gigantic is really just a small creation of our society -- with no society, there is no such thing as economy. And, society is really just a construct of nature: no nature, no society and thus no economy. So, all decisions are really decisiosnt aht need to be made in accordance with worrying about preserving nature/elongating the natural worlds energy outputs so we can keep this place as habitable as possible... These ideas get us closer to a "sustainable" mindset:

It's all the Blanket (I Heart Huckabees).

the Welfare of All Life (Massive Change/Bruce Mau).

All life should have the opportunity to Flourish (John Ehrenfeld).

These definitions deal with ethics and foresight... and understanding that everything is connected.

These ideas also get to be more Restorative; Preventative; Adaptive; Resilient...

However, they still don't make it clear what you are sustaining -- just a better vision for what we need to strive towards; how to intellectually wrap our minds better around the issues. See that we're alone and with finite resources.
