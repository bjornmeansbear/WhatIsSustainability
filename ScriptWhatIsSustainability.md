# What is Sustainability

I want to introduce some working definitions; a glossary of things for us to use as a shared reference. Start from zero. it doesn’t matter what you know, we’ll start from the same, shared initial frame of reference we can then build upon together.

If we are thinking about our world; our world is a vast set of 3D energy webs. Living beings; minerals, etc. all using and changing and releasing energy. We are on this spaceship earth, a term from buckminster fuller, flying through space on spaceship earth. We are a contained system. The only thing that enters our “spaceship” is solar energy and the occasional meteor. Heat and some light gasses leave our earth. Otherwise, what we have is all we have! finite!

Helium anecdote?

The point is we are a contained system. Everything is this interconnected flow of energy and life moving back and forth. we have to pay attention to how these flows work and where energy and resources are going. We will not be able to infinitely find more energy; more resources.

Art and Design continue to change culture and the world at large. 

The world is not going to be in the future the way it is now. If you believe in climate change, a lot is going to change in that way. But even if you don’t believe in CC there are power and social and cultural shifts happening (West to East?)

How to use sustainability as a sign? it has a lot of different semiotic meanings. It often means something different to a CEO than to Bill McKibben …

Think about climate change, consumerism, and other things in and around sustainability. How does this affect us as artists and designers? Is being a garbage collector better than being a designer in terms of improving things? can we be passionate about using an art or design practice to really change something?

## Latin roots; What does sustainability mean?
To sustain, to endure. This is why sustainability is used in so many different ways by so many different industries. It doesn’t automatically imply what you are trying to sustain, what you are trying to maintain. You could say that the status quo is sustainable; it sustains using up all our resources… Sustainability just means sustaining a thing into the future…

What are you trying to sustain? this is the question to ask oneself.

It is easy to be pessimistic. We have to remember, that for the most part the average person doesn’t wake up saying “what can I do to ruin everything for everyone else today?” — “What can I do to wreck the environment today?” — we’re just mainly like, hey, let’s go to work, lets do the regular old stuff… let’s just have a good day!

However, despite that not being anyone’s personal intention, despite not intending to destroy everything around us; somehow our collective actions ARE doing that! so what/where is the disconnect between what people’s individual intentions are and our culutural/societal global systems are doing? We are complicit as culture makers in these systems, so its another thing we have to be cognizant of!

## Definitions
At various points we’ve tried to describe what we mean when we say “sustainability”

Here are some basic definitions that try to use the basic, sustain things over time metric applied to various human situations...

- Any action that does not degrade the systems supporting it (General generic Definition of Sust.) [what is your system's boundary??? is it the whole universe? otherwise you won't really be sustainable]
- Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. (Brundtland Commission, 1987 -- by far the most reference "definition")
- Leave the world better than you found it, take no more than you need, try not to harm life or the environment, make amends if you do (Paul Hawken)
- Do unto others as you would have them do to you (the ethic of reciprocity; originally attributed to confuscious; aka the golden rule)
- Equity over time. Think of it as extending the golden rule through time... Do unto future generations as you would have them do unto you. (Robert Gilman, context institute)
- Living and working together for a common good. (Japanese principle of "Kyosei").
- Don't eat your seed corn (farmer colloquialism).
- Waste = Food (Cradle to Cradle/McDonough & Braungart).
- Improving the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of life's supporting systems (? attribute missing in my notes ?)\
- Living within limits.
- Art/Design that leaves the world better than we found it.
- Affluence without guilt; not sacrifice and restriction. (Alex Steffen, founder of WorldChanging).
- Spaceship Earth (Fullerism) -- remember, we live on a spaceship with finite resources -- pretty much the only inputs to our planetary system from outside are our sun's energy (and the occasionally meteorite). And we lose heat and helium out to space. Everything else is limited in supply; and is stuck here with us ...
- What to understand: Vast 3D webs of energy flows and living beings (living systems?) -- Everything is connected!
- Understanding the interconnections among economy, society, and environment (Everything is connected).
- It's all the Blanket (from _I Heart Huckabees_) — also just really Everything is Connected.
- the Welfare of All Life (Massive Change/Bruce Mau).
- All life should have the opportunity to Flourish (John Ehrenfeld).

These definitions deal with ethics and foresight... and understanding that everything is connected.

Sustainable living factors in these ideas. Good Morality; Good Foresight; Good Accounting for Interconnected systems... living in a way that accounts for people in the present AND in the future.

Restorative; Preventative; Adaptive; Resilience.

How do we actually do any of this? How do we consider how our actions now affect someone a century in the future!?

How do you bring “good” morality to your life and art/design practice?

## EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED
This is the key aphorism to walk away with. Each choice; each action is tied to so many others... And a "human" choice cannot be separated from societal or environmental ones. Every choice/action has impact everywhere.
