# What is Sustainability

I want to introduce some working definitions; a glossary of things for us to use as a shared reference. Start from zero. it doesn’t matter what you know, we’ll start from the same, shared initial frame of reference we can then build upon together.

If we are thinking about our world; our world is a vast set of 3D energy webs. Living beings; minerals, etc. all using and changing and releasing energy. We are on this spaceship earth, a term from buckminster fuller, flying through space on spaceship earth. We are a contained system. The only thing that enters our “spaceship” is solar energy and the occasional meteor. Heat and some light gasses leave our earth. Otherwise, what we have is all we have! finite!

Helium anecdote?

The point is we are a contained system. Everything is this interconnected flow of energy and life moving back and forth. we have to pay attention to how these flows work and where energy and resources are going. We will not be able to infinitely find more energy; more resources.

Art and Design continue to change culture and the world at large. 

The world is not going to be in the future the way it is now. If you believe in climate change, a lot is going to change in that way. But even if you don’t believe in CC there are power and social and cultural shifts happening (West to East?)

How to use sustainability as a sign? it has a lot of different semiotic meanings. It often means something different to a CEO than to Bill McKibben …

Think about climate change, consumerism, and other things in and around sustainability. How does this affect us as artists and designers? Is being a garbage collector better than being a designer in terms of improving things? can we be passionate about using an art or design practice to really change something?

## Latin roots; What does sustainability mean?
To sustain, to endure. This is why sustainability is used in so many different ways by so many different industries. It doesn’t automatically imply what you are trying to sustain, what you are trying to maintain. You could say that the status quo is sustainable; it sustains using up all our resources… Sustainability just means sustaining a thing into the future…

What are you trying to sustain? this is the question to ask oneself.

It is easy to be pessimistic. We have to remember, that for the most part the average person doesn’t wake up saying “what can I do to ruin everything for everyone else today?” — “What can I do to wreck the environment today?” — we’re just mainly like, hey, let’s go to work, lets do the regular old stuff… let’s just have a good day!

However, despite that not being anyone’s personal intention, despite not intending to destroy everything around us; somehow our collective actions ARE doing that! so what/where is the disconnect between what people’s individual intentions are and our culutural/societal global systems are doing? We are complicit as culture makers in these systems, so its another thing we have to be cognizant of!

## Definitions
At various points we’ve tried to describe what we mean when we say “sustainability”
